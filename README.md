# word-thing

This is a set of data for a project I'm making that concerns words and their divisions, specifically syllabically and etymologically.

## Data structure
The data follows this structure,
```
{
    "words": [
    {
       "word": "disestablishmentarianism",
       "syllabic": [0, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24],
       "etymological": [0, 3, 12, 17, 22],
       "prefix": ["dis"],
       "root": ["establish"],
       "suffix": ["ment", "arian", "ism"]
    },
    {
       "word": "insuffrable",
       "syllabic": [0, 2, 5, 8],
       "etymological": [0, 2, 7],
       "prefix": ["in"],
       "root": ["suffer"],
       "suffix": ["able"]
   }
]}
```

There are 6 entries per word, those being:\
- the word.
- the beginning indices of each syllable.
- the beginning indices of each etymological unit.
- the prefix(es).
- the root(s).
- the suffix(es).

Now, I'm absolutely sure that this method is not the best it could be. If you have suggestions on how it could be improved, PLEASE propose the idea.
If you're interested in contributing by adding words, then... (this README is not finished, sorry :à¤‰).
